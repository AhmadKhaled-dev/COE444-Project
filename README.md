# COE444-Project
In this project we focus on creating a safety system for a plant where the alarm will be triggered in two cases:
1. if there was a fire -Also the sprinklers will work-
2. if there was a gas leakage
a massage will be sent to both the fire department and the ambulance informing them about what type of emergency has occurred.
The details of the incident will be saved to “Firebase Database”
We’ve also added a remote Flow Controlling System where an Engineer can control the flow rate in a pipe remotely.
# Protocols Used
1.	RIP as a routing protocol 
2.	DHCP to assign IPs automatically to devices
